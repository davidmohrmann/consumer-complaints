# Consumer Complaints

The purpose of this project was to use pandas to read and analyze data from the CFPB database. This database is a collection of all complaints made by American consumers to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Using the included file, we wanted to calculate and chart the following:
  1. the number of complaints by product.
  2. the number of complaints by the top 10 complained of companies.
  3. the number of complaints by company response.
  4. the average number of complaints by day of the week.

Also, this jupyter notebook should be free of PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors.
